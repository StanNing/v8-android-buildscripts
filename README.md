# V8 build scripts for React Native Android

The aim of this project is to support V8 runtime for React Native.

## Integrate prebuilt V8 library

We publish prebuilt V8 shared libraries at npm.
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-android](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-android)

This makes upgrade V8 from React Native easier and is pretty much like what [jsc-android-buildscripts](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts) did.

To integrate with React Native, please check [react-native-v8](https://github.com/Kudo/react-native-v8).


## V8 Feature Flags

#### V8 comes in 4 flavours
 - v8 lite mode (memory optimized)
 - v8 lite mode + no intl (memory optimized + smaller size)
 - v8 JIT (performance optimized)
 - v8 JIT + no intl (performance optimized + smaller size)

#### Features
1. Single libv8android.so (or libv8.so on iOS) file.
2. Support i18n and JavaScript [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl).
3. V8 Lite mode (JIT-less mode) https://v8.dev/blog/v8-lite
4. Build by Android official NDK r19c which prevent potential ABI incompatible issue to integrate with React Native.
